# Open Source Contributions

This directory contains some of my contributions to open source software. This includes applications, demos, articles, research, and contributions to other open source software.

## Responsive Web Applications

[In-depth article](http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/12/building-a-responsive-web-application/) with [working demo](http://webpro.github.io/responsive-web-apps/) for responsive web applications.
Responsive design has changed the way we build websites, but now we need to take it to the next level and build responsive and hybrid applications.

## dyson

Simple yet powerful Node server to [create JSON endpoints](http://webpro.github.io/dyson/) to develop against when building web applications.
Configure endpoints using templates and simulate real services and data stores to boost development performance.
Additionally, I created [dyson-generators](https://github.com/webpro/dyson-generators) to generate fake data,
[dyson-image](https://github.com/webpro/dyson-generators) to serve dummy images (and base64 strings),
and a [small demo package](https://github.com/webpro/dyson-demo) [deployed at nodejitsu](http://dyson.jit.su/).

## baseplate

This project with working code, tooling and workflow represents [an excellent start to build web applications](https://github.com/webpro/baseplate) today.
Packed with features and pre-configured tooling, it gives a head start for scalable and maintanable projects.

## Automated SPA Testing

Research around solutions for automated unit and functional [testing of single-page applications](https://github.com/webpro/Automated-SPA-Testing) (SPA).
Requirements for potential solutions include performance, run tests in real browsers, code coverage, etc.
The results of this research are used in the baseplate project.

## Client-side Templating

Smashing Magazine featured my article about [client-side templating](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/05/client-side-templating/).

In the same area, this small repository about [pre-compiled templates](https://github.com/webpro/precompiled-templates) includes research and configuration for some template engines.
Minimal footprint and best performance are important factors here.
I also wrote Require.js plugins to compile templates at runtime and during the build process
([requirejs-handlebars](https://github.com/webpro/requirejs-handlebars), [requirejs-hogan](https://github.com/webpro/requirejs-hogan), and [requirejs-dust](https://github.com/webpro/requirejs-dust)).

## reveal-md

Small Node utility to [serve Markdown files](http://webpro.github.io/reveal-md/) as beautiful reveal.js presentations.
I once [extended reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/329) with the feature that allows writing slides in a single, separate Markdown file.
This command line utility is taking advantage of that by converting the Markdown file to a reveal.js presentation and serving it in the browser.

## Progressive Enhancement

These images to show the difference of [Websites vs Web Applications](https://github.com/webpro/Websites-vs-Web-Applications) may serve as a basis
to explain progressive enhancement and how it relates to websites, web applications, and overly complex, responsive & adaptive applications.

It's been a while since I wrote about [Progressive Enhancement](http://sixrevisions.com/web-development/progressive-enhancement/) on Six Revisions, but the concept is still relevant as ever.

## Sandbox

It deserves a little more love, but the [WebPro Sandbox](http://sandbox.webpro.nl) has quite some interesting tests and demos for CSS3 features and HTML5 API's that are still new and relevant.
